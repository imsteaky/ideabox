# DTR - Ideabox

## Group Member Names: Thomas Scully / Nick Dambrosio

### Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?

Thomas:

Nick: I hope to improve my grasp on javascript, specifically with DOM manipulation (without over referencing previous projects). 
I'm also very interested in mastering storing user inputted data in local storage as it's something I've played with before, but don't 
remember how it's written.

### Goals and Expectations

Thomas:

Nick: I expect thorough communication and thoughtful planning to be put into each step of the project before anything is executed 
or committed. Previous projects have proven that having a firm grasp on Github and pushing proper commits to their respective branches 
are imperitive to the success for the success of a project. We have a trello established for project management and while I don't expect 
Thomas to live/die by it, I would appreciate it if he makes thoughtful updates to it throughout the project so we can be on the same page about 
each others progress at all times. Link to trello board below.

### Team Strengths

Communication, organization, proper planning, flexible schedules. 

### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?)

Thomas:

Nick: I'm generally free at all hours of the day, but we've established that a Saturday meetup would be beneficial. Our current priorities
going into this weekend is the static comp challenge, but I'll likely get a mockup of the site working by Saturday or Sunday so we can 
spend the majority of the worktime allotted to us throughout the week focusing on JS.

### Communication Expectations (How and how often will we communicate? How do we keep communication lines open?)

Slack as much as possible. Even if it's just brief messages stating that a certain feature has been completed or a
new branch has been added. Keep each other in the loop as much as possible. There's no such thing as over communication
over slack. Work together daily as much as possible and run through every line of code to make sure that both members understand
every line as well as possible.

### Abilities Expectations:

Thomas:

Nick: Improve DOM manipulation understanding and doing it from scratch. Master the art of local storage.

### Workload Expectations (What features do we want to work on?)

TBD
